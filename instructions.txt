Dev Workflow
------------
0. Prelude
git fetch
git status

1. Create a feature branch
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/f000n

2. Changes / debugging
git fetch
git status
git add *
git commit -m "blah blah"
etc.

3. Tested and ready to get it into develop as one simple commit
git checkout develop
git merge --squash feature/f00xx
git commit -m "f00xx"
git push

4. Delete Unwanted feature branch (i.e. AFTER merge to develop)
git branch -d feature/f00xx
git push origin --delete feature/f00xx

5. Tag a pre-release (will cause a release build draft in github)
git tag f000n
git push origin f000n

6. Delete Tag
git tag -d f00xx
git push --delete origin f00xx

7. Merge into master
git checkout master
git merge develop
git push

8. Tag a release
git tag v1.x.y
git push origin v1.x.y
